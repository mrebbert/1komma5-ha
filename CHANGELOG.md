# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.1.32] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Re-authentication flow**: when 1KOMMA5° credentials become invalid, HA automatically shows a "Re-authentication required" notification — enter new credentials in place without losing sensor history
- **Reconfigure flow**: proactive credential updates via Settings → Devices & Services → 1KOMMA5° → Reconfigure
- **Service `onekommafive.get_cheapest_window`**: find the cheapest contiguous N-minute window in the price forecast — returns start/end timestamps and average price for use in automations (dishwasher, washing machine, EV, heat pump scheduling)
- **Negative Price Slots Tomorrow** sensor: count of 15-min slots tomorrow with negative price (available after ~13:00 CET)
- **Cheapest Hour Now** binary sensor: ON when the current 15-min slot is the cheapest in the next ~30h of forecast

### Changed
- Bumped minimum Home Assistant version to **2024.10** (required for `_get_reauth_entry`, `_get_reconfigure_entry`, and `data_updates` helper)
- **Cheap Electricity** binary sensor: now updates dynamically every 15 minutes (was previously only updated on coordinator refresh)

## [0.1.31] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Optimization sensors**: 5 new sensors exposing Heartbeat AI optimization decisions (event count, cost/savings, energy bought/sold, last decision) — updated every 15 minutes
- **Diagnostic sensors**: 3 new timestamp sensors tracking the last successful API update for each coordinator (live, price, optimization) — `entity_category: diagnostic`
- **Price statistics**: negative price slots today, tomorrow's average/lowest/highest price
- **Long-term statistics**: all price sensors now use `state_class: measurement`, enabling HA to record hourly min/max/mean automatically

### Fixed
- Negative electricity prices are now handled correctly — the stable price sensor accepts negative values and the cost sensor reduces accumulated costs during negative price periods
- Price coordinator first refresh is no longer fatal — if the initial fetch fails (e.g. API rate limit), the integration starts normally
- EMS `DeviceGateway not found` error no longer blocks integration setup — EMS switch becomes unavailable while other sensors continue working

### Changed
- Removed `device_class: monetary` from price sensors (incompatible with `state_class: measurement` in HA)
- Documentation: all entity names translated to English with translation key references

## [0.1.26] - 2026-03-21

### Changed

## [0.1.23] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Electricity Cost** sensor: accumulated grid import cost (dynamic price × kWh, integrates with HA Energy Dashboard)
- **Feed-in Revenue** sensor: accumulated feed-in revenue (configurable tariff)
- **Cheap Electricity** binary sensor: ON when current electricity price is below today's average
- **Battery Charge Energy** / **Battery Discharge Energy** sensors (split for HA Energy Dashboard)
- Options flow: feed-in tariff configurable via integration settings (default 0.0803 €/kWh)
- Dashboard: new "Prices and Costs" view with cost stats and monthly apexcharts chart

## [0.1.22] - 2026-03-07
